**About me**

```
Name: Justin,
Status: second year DS university student,
Located: Australia 🇦🇺
```
>I love to speak with people whose **model of the world** differ from mine.
><br>My craft of choice is data science because it is post-structural, completely independent of our human biases (if we make it so)
><br>...and because statistics tickle my brain, data ⇒ semantic modelling ⇒  `literally { EVERYTHING } ⊆ Data Science`, and it is the closest thing we have to magic ✧.
